#### Learning Objectives
-   Obtain a further understanding of Python syntax through solving algorithm problems
-   Traverse and retrieve data from nested objects and two-dimensional lists
-   Importing modules, some fun with random

## Syntax / Best Practices (Cont.)
-   Solving algorithms with Python
    -   Large Number - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.
    -   First Plus Length - Create a function that accepts a list and returns the sum of the first value in the list plus the list's length.
    -   Ultimate Analysis - Create a function that takes a list and returns a dictionary that has the sumTotal, average, minimum, maximum and length of the list.

## Object Traversal
-   Accessing dictionary/list values (see Great Number Game)

## Modules
-   Writing your own modules
    -   Why? What is modularization?
-   Manipulating the random module

## GREAT NUMBER GAME

-   Construct a list of player objects.
    -   Player objects must include Name, Score, and Guess

-   Write a function that, given a list of player objects, returns the player that receives the highest score.
    -   A random number between 1 and 10 is generated.
    -   Numbers greater than random number gain 10 points.
    -   Numbers less than random number gain 5 points.
    -   Numbers even with random number gain 15 points.

-   BONUS TASKS

-   Write a function that accepts a player object and some num below 10, allow for num to be the players new guess.

-   Write a function 'rounds' that accepts an integer of rounds to be played, return the player with the highest score after number of rounds.
